## Assessment


I found runfibs.sh challenging. I really appreciate when the assignment tests my knowlege and pushes my familiarity with python and especially bash. The overlap of python and bash were useful because bash is still fairly new and the constant repetition of its usage solidifies my knowledge. Writing to a .csv was also challenging, but we got though it.
